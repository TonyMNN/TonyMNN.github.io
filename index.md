### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite of mine because it is my introduction to code! I will always remember the rite of passage all computer scientists go through in printing "Hello World!" Furthermore, it is the start of my journey on computer science, to achieve a dream that I've had since I was gifted my first laptop; mainly to understand how it worked.
* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was another favorite of mine because it was my first time that I was really challenged in my lab and truly went through the process of problem-solving and debugging. I remember the feeling of satisfaction when everything ran perfectly fine and the joy of knowing I created the program from the ground-up (almost at least.) Overall, it was a fun lab that slightly challenged me but wasn't rage-inducing.
* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was another favorite of mine because of my partner for this lab. I normally don't meet up with my partners outside of the lab but for this one we decided to meet in the computer lab. Together we solved the problems the lab set out for us and even agreed that we should work together to create a personal project together with code. This lab is memorable because of a friend I've made!
